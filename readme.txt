A starter theme template based on underscores, tailored for transit sites.

== Description ==

This is a starter theme meant to work in tandem with the [Transit Custom Posts](https://github.com/trilliumtransit/transit-custom-posts) plugin.
The Transit Base Template can be used as a starting point for integrating GTFS data into your Wordpress site or 
even just a working example for how to use the functions from the Transit Custom Posts API. We don't recommend using
this theme as a parent theme just yet, at least not until a more stable release.

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.
